# Exercise 6.2-3

## Write down all 16 tests to satisfy Multiple Base Choice coverage (MBCC) for the second categorization of `triang()`’s inputs in Table 6.2. Use the values in Table 6.3.

The two base tests are (2, 2, 2) and (1, 2, 2), and the following additional tests would be needed:
* For base test (2, 2, 2):
(0, 2, 2)	(-1, 2, ,2)
(2, 1, 2)	(2, 0, 2)	(2, -1, 2)
(2, 2, 1)	(2, 2, 0)	(2, 2, -1)

* For base test (1, 2, 2):
(0, 2, 2)	(−1, 2, 2)
(1, 1, 2)	(1, 0, 2)	(1, −1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)	(1, 2, 0)	(1, 2, −1)
