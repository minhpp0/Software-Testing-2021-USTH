Exercise 3.2

Give a one-to-two paragraph explanation for how the inheritance hierarchy can affect controllability and observability.

Explain how the inheritance structure affects controllability and observability in one to two paragraphs.
In object-oriented programming, inheritance can make controllability and observability difficult. In some circumstances, a superclass has so many subclasses that it's difficult to keep track of each class's functions and methods.
Furthermore, methods can be overridden by a subclass, making test cases much more difficult to come up with.
The developer, on the other hand, can visualize the entire system of classes more simply with the help of an inheritance hierarchy. They would know where to begin and what to consider while creating test case sets.
