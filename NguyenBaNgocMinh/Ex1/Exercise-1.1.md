Exercise 1.1

What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizerâ€™s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?
From level 2 to level 3 testing, the goal is to demonstrate presence rather than failure or absence. We must acknowledge that time we use software, we put ourselves at danger. Risk can be minor and unimportant, or it can be significant and have disastrous repercussions, but risk is always present. Level 3 testing entails collaboration between testers and developers in order to reduce risk.
