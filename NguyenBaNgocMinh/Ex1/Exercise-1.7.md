Ex 1.7 
Consider the following three example classes. These are OO faults taken from Joshua Blochâ€™s Effective Java, Second Edition. Answer the following questions about each.

(a) Describe the flaws in the supplied code. Propose a code update to accurately describe the problem.
(b) Provide a test case that does not execute the fault if possible. If not, give a concise explanation of why not.
(c) Provide a test case that executes the fault but does not result in an error state if at all possible. If not, give a concise explanation of why not.
(d) Provide a test scenario that results in an error but not a failure, if possible. If not, give a concise explanation of why not. Remember to keep an eye on the program counter.
(e) Describe the first error state in the given code. Make careful to convey the entire situation.
(f) Implement your repair and verify that the given test now produces the expected output. Submit a screen printout or other evidence that your new program works
