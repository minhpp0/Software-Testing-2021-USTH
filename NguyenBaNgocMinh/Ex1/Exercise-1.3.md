Exercise 1.3 
What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk? ” What risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero?

There are various reasons why systems fail due to a lack of testing, which is why testing is done to avoid future risk.
The risk could be minor and trivial, or it may be significant and have disastrous repercussions. It could be a slew of problems, flaws, or glitches.
We can't make the risk disappear since it's always here; we just don't recognize it.
