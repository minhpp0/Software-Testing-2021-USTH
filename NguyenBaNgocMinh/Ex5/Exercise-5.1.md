Exercise 5.1
Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2. Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P, and test set T2 satisfies C2, also on P.
(a) Yes, because T1 satisfies C1 and C1 subsumes C2.

(b) No, because T2 only satisfies C2, which is smaller than C1.

(c) The situation here is T2 reveals the fault in P but T1 does necessarily also reveal it. We have the following posibilies:

T2 may have the specific design/test to reveal the fault and T1 simply doesn't.
The test set in T2 is not even the subset of the test set in T1.
